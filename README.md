There are also Counter task and Foursquare. To run them you have to run app and foursquare_app modules accordingly

And.. Foursquare authorization api requires app's sha1 hash to be placed somwhere on the foursquare project's ??movement?? sdk page which is not available for standart accounts I suppose, so when there is a token exception it'll just be replaced in the catch block by a random string.
